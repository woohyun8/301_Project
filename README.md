# Trend of Malaria Infection in South Korea

### Introduction: 

This project analyzes malaria infection trends in South Korea from 2001 to 2023. Our research question was: “How have malaria patterns in South Korea changed over this period?” To answer this, we compared malaria trends in neighboring countries and examined infection rates in key regions, particularly Seoul, Gyeonggi, Gangwon, and Incheon.

Using animated maps and line graphs, we visualized the changes in infection rates and identified regions with consistently high malaria cases. By comparing these patterns with the implementation of key policies, we aimed to provide recommendation that could help minimize future malaria infections.

This study provides

- Valuable insights for malaria prevention strategies 

- Offers practical implications for future health policy development in South Korea
